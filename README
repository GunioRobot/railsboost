== Rails Boost ==

Rails boost is a very simple project based around making it very, very
easy to create templates for your Rails 2.3.1+ projects.

Stop bootstrapping manually. Stop using old pulls of Rails. Start being
more productive.

1) Migrate the DB
2) Execute `rake command:load` which grabs all of the commands from the remote server
3) Read the TODO file
4) Start hacking!
